Codeforces is a website that hosts competitive programming contests.[1] It is maintained by a group of competitive programmers from ITMO University led by Mikhail Mirzayanov.[2] Since 2013, Codeforces claims to surpass Topcoder in terms of active contestants.[3] As of 2018, it has over 600,000 registered users.[4] Codeforces along with other similar websites are used by top sport programmers like Gennady Korotkevich, Petr Mitrichev, Benjamin Qi and Makoto Soejima, and by other programmers interested in furthering their careers.[5][6][7]


The Codeforces platform is typically used when preparing for competitive programming contests[8][9][10][11] and it offers the following features:

- Short (2-hours) contests, called "Codeforces Rounds", held about once a week[12][13]
- Educational contests (2-2.5 hours, with 24 hours hacking period),[14] held 2-3 times per month;
- Challenge/hack other contestants' solutions;
- Solve problems from previous contests for training purposes;
- "Polygon" feature for creating and testing problems;
- Social networking through internal public blogs.

Contestants are rated by a system similar to Elo rating system. There are usually no prizes for winners, though several times a year special contests are held, in which top performing contestants receive T-shirts. Some bigger contests are hosted on Codeforces base, among them "The Lyft Level 5 Challenge 2018", provided by Lyft [15] or "Microsoft Q# Coding Contest â€” Summer 2018" provided by Microsoft.[16]

Contestants are divided into ranks based on their ratings.
